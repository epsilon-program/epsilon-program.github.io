## 2. The Pledge
All good things come from Kraff, that is the fact on which Epsilonism is built.
<br>
Epsilonism is a science as well as a Religion - in fact, we are the only religion that is also a science and which is concerned with seeking the truth.
<br>
As real truth seekers, we are willing to pay to make the search go better. In this way we are investing in our future.
<br>
Kraff within us, Kraff's will be done.
<br>
ALL PRAISE BE TO KRAFF!
