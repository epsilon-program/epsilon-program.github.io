## 1. Roleplay Standards
1. Roleplay the Epsilon Program as though you were in a cult.
2. You must maintain a high standard of roleplay at all times.
3. Every member is to roleplay a form of submission to 'The Father' and to 'Kraff.'
4. You are expected to stray away from pretty crimes unless notified by, 'The Father.'
5. We advise your character remains oddly happy at all times for added creepiness.

## 2. Faction Rules
1. The only way to leave the faction is through a CK.
2. You may not be corrupt without permission from, 'The Father.'
3. You must obey the chain of command.

## 3. Leave of Absence
If you are going to be able away for more than 3 days, please inform the father to avoid being kicked out of the faction.
