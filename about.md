## The Goals of Epsilonism

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
I. We are making an assault on happiness.
II. We will be generous, in ways that are upwards and ways that are manifest.
III. We will live by the proven scientific truth of the metaphors.
IV. We will fight superstition, limited thinking and dogma wherever we find it.
V. We will be clear thinking, independent minded and do exactly what we are told.
VI. We will practice science by not doubting.
VII. We will display infinite power by closing out those with doubt with our life choices.
VIII. We will practice kindness and mercy by a relentless assault on insavables, always reminding them of what awaits.
IX. We will be everywhere, all at once, but also right here, right now.
X. We will invest in a structured study program, because we know that knowledge is not free.
XI. We will be open minded to new experiences apart from those that are wrong, insavable, or against teachings.
XII. We will promote epsilonism in everything we do, while we await both the writing of the tract and the ending of the 9th paradigm.


## The Epsilon Pledge
<div class="box">
  <p>
  All good things come from Kraff, that is the fact on which Epsilonism is built.

Epsilonism is a science as well as a Religion - in fact, we are the only religion that is also a science and which is concerned with seeking the truth.

As real truth seekers, we are willing to pay to make the search go better. In this way we are investing in our future.
